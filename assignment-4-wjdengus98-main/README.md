# Digital Image Processing 
Assignment #4

Due: Fri 05/03/24 11:59 PM


Note: As it is the last week of the semester, it will not be possible to accommodate any extensions to this deadline. 

**Filtering:**

Write code for computing Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, Adaptive Local Noise reduction, and Adaptive Median filters. 
The input to your program is a 2D matrix.

  - Starter code available in directory Denoise/
      - \__init__(): Will initialize the required variable for filtering (image, filter_name, filter_size). There is no need to edit this function  
  - Denoise/Filtering.py: Edit the functions 'get_median_filter', 'get_arithmetic_mean', 'get_geometric_mean', 'get_local_noise', and 'get_adaptive_mean'. you are welcome to add more functions.
  - For this part of the assignment, please implement your own code for all computations, do not use built-in functions, like "medianBlur", "MaxFilter", "numpy.pad" from PIL, opencv or other libraries - that directly accomplish the objective of the question. You can use any math (import math) related functions such as "prod", "pow" and "sum".
    You can also make use of Python built-in functions such as "sorted" for order statistic filters.   
  
filtering(): Write your code to perform image denoising/filtering here using the previously implemented filters. The steps can be used as a guideline for filtering. All the variables have already been initialized and can be used as self.image, self.filter_name, etc. The variable self.filter is a handle to each of the five filter functions. 
  - The function returns the denoised image.
  - This part of the assignment can be run using dip_hw_filter.py (there is no need to edit this file)
  - Usage: 
  
        ./dip_hw_filter.py -i Lenna.png -f arithmetic_mean -n gaussian
        python dip_hw_filter.py -i Lenna.png -f arithmetic_mean -n gaussian
        
  - Please make sure your code runs when you run the above command from the prompt/terminal
  - Any output images or files must be saved to the "output/" folder (dip_hw_filter.py automatically does this)
  - Two images are provided for testing: Lenna.png and Lenna0.jpg

**Note:**
You are **restricted from importing cv2, numpy, stats and other third party libraries,** 
with the only exception of math, importing math library is allowed (import math).

While you can import it for testing purposes, the final submission should not contain the following statements.
- import cv2
- import numpy
- import numpy as np
- import stats
- etc...

The essential functions for the assignment are available in dip module one can import using the following statement
```
import dip
from dip import *
```
The following functions are available

```commandline
from cv2 import namedWindow, imshow, waitKey, imwrite, imread, putText
from cv2 import FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, LINE_AA
from cv2 import ellipse, rectangle, circle

from numpy import zeros, ones, array, shape, arange
from numpy import random
from numpy import min, max
from numpy import uint8
from numpy import inf
from numpy.fft import fft2, fftshift, ifftshift, ifft2

import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

*Assignments that contain any files that import these libraries will not be graded.* 
*Assignments that modify the dip.py file will not be graded.*
  
PS. Files not to be changed: requirements.txt and Jenkins file 
  
1. Any output file or image should be written to the output/ folder

The TA will only be able to see your results if this condition is met

1. Filtering       - 60 Pts.
 
    Total          - 60 Pts.
